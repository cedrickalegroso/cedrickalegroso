## ⚠️ Project Archive Notice
**All projects above are archived and no longer maintained.** I've tried to open-source as many as possible, but some repositories contain incomplete code, prototypes, or proof-of-concepts created for proposals and hackathons.

**API Security Disclaimer**: Some projects may have API keys or sensitive data removed/hidden - I don't trust my younger self with environment variables! 😅 If you're interested in any specific project's full implementation, feel free to reach out.
